This project is part of the 316 unit of the Software Engineering Bootcamp at Per Scholas. It is a JavaScript-based game that focuses on DOM manipulation. The game challenges players to "catch" a moving button by clicking on it as quickly as possible. Each successful click reduces the time available to catch the button, making the game progressively more difficult.
